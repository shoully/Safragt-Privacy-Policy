# Safragt Game Privacy Policy

I, Ihab Shouly, developed this game "Safargt" as an ad-supported app. This service is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform you of my policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information if anyone decides to use my service.

If you choose to use my service, you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The personal information I collect is used for providing and improving the service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this privacy policy.

## Purpose and Scope
This game is supported by non-intrusive ads. Players can choose to watch ads to earn credits by clicking the ads button. You can play the game without watching ads if you prefer. The ads do not include pop-ups or other annoying forms.

## Information Collection and Use
I collect data using Google Analytics, like your city, playtime, phone type, and other technical information to improve the appâ€™s performance and understand user needs. This data is used to enhance performance and the user experience.

To save information like game scores and game preferences, I use local storage on your device. If you play the game online, your game scores and preferences are saved in Firebase.

## Security
I value your trust in providing us with your personal information, so I strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. I use encryption (SSL) to protect data during online transmission, and I implement authentication to access the online game. Each user can only access their own game data. I update the app at least once a year.
