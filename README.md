## Safragt Game Privacy Policy


I, Ihab Shoully, developed this game "Safarjat" as an ad-supported application. This service is provided free of charge and is for personal use only.

This page informs you about my policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when you use my service.

If you choose to use my service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. The personal information I collect is used to provide and improve the service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.  

**Purpose and Scope**

This app is supported by non-intrusive ads. You can choose to watch ads for in-game credits or play without them. Ads do not include pop-ups or other disruptive formats.
I collect data using Google Analytics (city, play duration, device type) to improve app performance and understand user needs. This data is non-personal and used for improvement purposes.

**Information Collection and Use**

The app may request information to enhance your experience, but it will be stored on your device and not collected by me. The app uses third-party services that may collect identifiable information.

**Log Data**

When you use the service, I may collect log data (through third-party products) on your device in case of an app error. This includes your device's IP address, name, operating system version, app configuration, and the time/date of service use.

**Cookies**

This service does not directly use cookies, but third-party libraries or algorithms within the app may use them for information collection and service improvement. Since the app is mobile-based and uses an internal SQLite database for settings and in-game credits, cookies are not utilized.

**Service Providers**

I may employ third-party companies or individuals to facilitate our service, provide the service on my behalf, perform service-related tasks, or analyze how the service is used. These third parties have access to your personal information only to perform these tasks and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.  

**Security**

I value your trust in providing personal information. I strive to use commercially acceptable means of protection. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage method is 100% secure, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Links to Other Sites**

This service may contain links to other sites. Clicking on a third-party link will direct you to that site. I strongly advise you to review the privacy policies of these external sites, as I have no control over their content, privacy practices, or services.  

**Children's Privacy**

This game is similar to tic-tac-toe and suitable for all ages. If I learn a child under 13 has provided personal information, I will delete it immediately. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information, please contact me so I can take necessary actions.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

I may update this Privacy Policy periodically. You are advised to review this page for any changes. I will notify you of changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately upon posting.
